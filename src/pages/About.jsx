      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Isael Ramirez, a recent graduate with a degree in Computer
        Science based in Austin, Texas. My passion for cars and the vibrant
        culture surrounding them has been a significant part of my life. I
        cherish the connections, joy, and memories that come from being immersed
        in the automotive world. Photography has allowed me to capture these
        moments and share them with others. For many, cars are more than just a
        mode of transportationâ€”they are a form of self-expression. I take great
        pride in capturing the effort and creativity people pour into their
        vehicles, preserving the essence of their individuality through my
        camera lens.
